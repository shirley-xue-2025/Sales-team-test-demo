Thank you for the latest changes. The console now shows detailed logging, which is very helpful!

Current Behavior:

Console Output: When I click a product checkbox (e.g., 'scaling-blueprint' which is initially checked):
The console correctly logs:
[useProductSelection] toggleProduct called with ID: scaling-blueprint
[useProductSelection] Product ID scaling-blueprint is currently selected. Removing.
[useProductSelection] Previous selected IDs: (7) […]
[useProductSelection] New selected IDs after removal: (6) […]
[ProductSelectionModal] onSelectedProductsChange called with: (6) […]
[ProductSelectionModal] New Selected Product IDs: (6) […]
This indicates the internal state array for selected product IDs is being updated correctly (e.g., from 7 items down to 6).
UI Problem: Despite the internal state updating (as seen in the logs), the UI does not reflect this change:
The checkbox for 'scaling-blueprint' remains visually checked.
The "Select (7)" button at the bottom of the modal still says 7.
Event Listener: The click event listener on the underlying <button> DOM element still correctly shows f noop() from react-dom.development.js, which is expected for React.
This strongly suggests that while the state update logic in useProductSelection (or equivalent) is working, the React components (ProductSelectionModal and/or the individual Checkbox component) are not re-rendering correctly to reflect this updated state.

Could you please:

Review the ProductSelectionModal.tsx component (or the component responsible for rendering the list of checkboxes):

Ensure it's correctly receiving the updated list of selected product IDs as a prop after useProductSelection updates the state.
Ensure it's correctly passing the checked status (derived from the updated selected IDs) to each individual checkbox component.
Verify that there are no issues (like incorrect React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate logic) preventing it from re-rendering when its props change.
Review the custom Checkbox.tsx component:

Ensure it correctly uses the checked prop passed to it to determine its visual state.
Ensure its internal onClick or onChange handler is correctly calling the function passed via props (which should ultimately trigger toggleProduct in useProductSelection).
Provide the current code for:

The part of ProductSelectionModal.tsx that maps over products and renders each checkbox.
The Checkbox.tsx component itself.
The toggleProduct function (and related state update logic) within useProductSelection.ts.
The main goal is to ensure the UI re-renders to match the (correctly updated) internal state when a product is unselected."
