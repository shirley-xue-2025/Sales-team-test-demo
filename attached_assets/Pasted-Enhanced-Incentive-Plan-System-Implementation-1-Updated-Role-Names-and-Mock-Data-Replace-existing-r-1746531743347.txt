Enhanced Incentive Plan System Implementation
1. Updated Role Names and Mock Data
Replace existing role names with real use case names:
"Sales Manager" → "Setter"
"Sales Representative" → "Junior Closer"
"Junior Sales" → "Senior Closer"
Update all role descriptions to match the new role types
Update references across all components and pages
2. Separate Viewing and Editing Experiences
Implement product selection functionality:
Add selected: boolean property to Product interface
Create mechanisms to select/deselect products for each role
Store selected products separately from all available products
In edit mode: show all products (20)
In view mode: show only selected products (10, 11, etc.)
Update store interface to track selected products per role
3. Realistic Product Names for Online Business Coaching
Replace generic product names with coaching-relevant names:
"1-on-1 Strategy Session"
"Business Growth Masterclass"
"Leadership Coaching Program"
"Sales Acceleration Workshop"
"Marketing Mindset Course"
"CEO Mentoring Package"
"Social Media Authority Program"
"Email Marketing Mastery"
"Client Acquisition System"
"Business Scaling Blueprint"
etc.
4. Rename "Global Plan" to "Default Template"
Update all UI labels and references to use "Default Template" instead of "Global Plan"
Make the template purpose clearer in the UI with better descriptions
Update store logic to reflect this conceptual change
5. Adaptive Interface Based on Role Count
Add role count detection mechanism in IncentivePlanPage
For single-role scenarios:
Simplify by removing tabs
Present direct incentive configuration
Remove "role-specific" terminology
For multi-role scenarios:
Maintain tab structure with improved framing
6. Role Comparison View Implementation
Create new "Role Combination" tab alongside "Default Template" and role-specific tabs
Develop matrix view with multi-role selection checkboxes:
Allow selecting combinations of roles (Setter + Junior Closer, etc.)
Display product rows with selected role columns
Show commission/bonus values in cells
Add dynamic "Total" column showing combined commission/bonus
Implement visual indicators:
Color coding for commission differences
Highlighting for significant variations between roles
Clear visualization of combined team commission structures
Add sorting/filtering capabilities:
Sort by highest/lowest commission
Filter by selected products only
7. Enhanced Store Implementation
Update incentiveStore to support:
Tracking selected products for each role
Calculating combined incentives for role combinations
Supporting the view/edit mode separation
Storing the default template instead of global plan
Add helper functions:
getSelectedProductsForRole(roleId)
calculateCombinedIncentives(roleIds)
toggleProductSelection(roleId, productId, selected)
8. Improved User Experience
Add clear visual distinction between edit and view modes
Implement tooltips explaining the Default Template concept
Add sorting and filtering capabilities to all product tables
Provide clean navigation between roles and incentive configuration pages
Add visualization of commission breakdowns in the comparison view
Based on my analysis of the current codebase, here's how we would implement these changes:

1. Updating Role Names and Product Names
First, we'll update the role names throughout the system to reflect the real use cases (Setter, Junior Closer, Senior Closer) and replace the generic product names with coaching-relevant ones. This will involve modifying the mock data in several files.

2. Separating View and Edit Modes
The current implementation doesn't have a clear separation between viewing and editing products. We'll need to:

Add a selected property to the Product interface
Modify the store to track which products are selected for each role
Update UI components to show all products in edit mode, but only selected products in view mode
Add UI controls to toggle product selection
3. Role Comparison View
The most significant addition will be the new Role Comparison View that allows you to:

Select combinations of roles (Setter + Junior Closer, etc.)
See the total commission and bonus for these combinations
Quickly toggle between different combinations
Visually identify differences between roles
This will require creating a new tab in the IncentivePlanPage with a matrix-style view showing products as rows and selected roles as columns, with dynamic totals that update as you select/deselect roles.

4. Store Enhancements
The incentiveStore will need significant updates to support:

Tracking selected products separately from all available products
Calculating combined incentives for multiple roles
Supporting the "Default Template" concept instead of "Global Plan"
5. Adaptive Interface
We'll implement logic to detect when there's only one role in the system and adapt the UI accordingly, removing unnecessary complexity when it's not needed.
