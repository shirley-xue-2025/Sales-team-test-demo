Okay, we have new information!

image_c4115a.jpg: This shows the "Select products" modal and the console after Replit AI's latest changes.
image_c41447.png: This is the "Event Listeners" tab for the checkbox button, again showing the handler: f noop() from react-dom.development.js.
Analysis of the New Information:

Console Output (image_c4115a.jpg):

The console is now VERY verbose when you click! This is actually a good sign in terms of getting feedback, even if it's not the final desired state.
It's logging many objects and messages. I can see lines like:
[ProductSelectionModal] New Selected Product IDs: (6) […]
[useProductSelection] toggleProduct called with ID: scaling-blueprint
[useProductSelection] Product ID scaling-blueprint is currently selected. Removing.
[useProductSelection] Previous selected IDs: (7) […]
[useProductSelection] New selected IDs after removal: (6) […]
[ProductSelectionModal] onSelectedProductsChange called with: (6) […]
It seems to be correctly identifying the product ID, recognizing it's selected, and attempting to remove it. The arrays of selected IDs seem to be changing correctly in the logs.
Crucially, the UI in the modal still shows "Select (7)" and the "scaling-blueprint" checkbox is still checked.
Event Listener (image_c41447.png):

The direct event handler on the button#product-1-on-1 (which we assume is representative of all such checkbox buttons) is still f noop() originating from react-dom.development.js.
This is consistent with how React works. React attaches its own listener to the actual DOM element and then dispatches events to your component's handlers (like onClick or onChange passed as props). So, seeing noop here is normal for a React application.
The Core Problem Now Seems to Be a React State/Re-render Issue:

The logs strongly suggest that:

The event is being caught (likely by a handler attached as a prop in the JSX, not the noop one).
The logic to update the internal state (the array of selected product IDs) is running correctly. The console logs show the ID being removed from the array.
However, the UI (the checkbox's checked status and the "Select (7)" button) is not updating to reflect this internal state change.

This usually points to one of these common React issues:

State Not Being Properly "Lifted" or Passed Down: The component that renders the checkboxes (ProductSelectionModal?) might not be re-rendering when the selectedProducts state changes, or it's not receiving the updated state correctly as props.
Incorrect Prop for Checked State: The custom Checkbox.tsx component might not be using the prop that tells it whether it's checked or unchecked correctly, or that prop isn't being updated.
Mutation of State Instead of Creating New State: React relies on immutable state updates to detect changes. If the array of selected IDs is being mutated directly (e.g., using array.splice() without creating a new array), React might not "see" the change and thus won't re-render. However, the logs showing "New selected IDs after removal" with a count of 6 suggest new arrays are likely being created (e.g., with .filter()).
Memoization Issues: If components like ProductSelectionModal or Checkbox.tsx are wrapped in React.memo or use shouldComponentUpdate, they might be incorrectly preventing re-renders if the props comparison is flawed.
Key Issues in Lists: If the products are rendered in a list, missing or incorrect key props on list items can sometimes lead to weird UI update behaviors, though it's less likely to be the primary cause for this specific issue if the state itself logs correctly.
Revised Prompt for Replit AI:

Based on these new findings, here's a more targeted prompt:

"Thank you for the latest changes. The console now shows detailed logging, which is very helpful!

Current Behavior:

Console Output: When I click a product checkbox (e.g., 'scaling-blueprint' which is initially checked):
The console correctly logs:
[useProductSelection] toggleProduct called with ID: scaling-blueprint
[useProductSelection] Product ID scaling-blueprint is currently selected. Removing.
[useProductSelection] Previous selected IDs: (7) […]
[useProductSelection] New selected IDs after removal: (6) […]
[ProductSelectionModal] onSelectedProductsChange called with: (6) […]
[ProductSelectionModal] New Selected Product IDs: (6) […]
This indicates the internal state array for selected product IDs is being updated correctly (e.g., from 7 items down to 6).
UI Problem: Despite the internal state updating (as seen in the logs), the UI does not reflect this change:
The checkbox for 'scaling-blueprint' remains visually checked.
The "Select (7)" button at the bottom of the modal still says 7.
Event Listener: The click event listener on the underlying <button> DOM element still correctly shows f noop() from react-dom.development.js, which is expected for React.
This strongly suggests that while the state update logic in useProductSelection (or equivalent) is working, the React components (ProductSelectionModal and/or the individual Checkbox component) are not re-rendering correctly to reflect this updated state.

Could you please:

Review the ProductSelectionModal.tsx component (or the component responsible for rendering the list of checkboxes):

Ensure it's correctly receiving the updated list of selected product IDs as a prop after useProductSelection updates the state.
Ensure it's correctly passing the checked status (derived from the updated selected IDs) to each individual checkbox component.
Verify that there are no issues (like incorrect React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate logic) preventing it from re-rendering when its props change.
