I'm still having an issue with the product selection checkboxes in the modal you coded. When I click a checkbox to unselect a product, the checkbox blinks but remains selected, and the product is not unselected. Nothing new appears in the browser console when I click.

We've done some debugging using the browser's developer tools and found the following:

When inspecting the specific <button role="checkbox" ...> element for a product (e.g., id="product-1-on-1"), the 'Event Listeners' tab shows that for the click event, the direct handler on the button is f noop().
Further inspection of this noop() handler indicates it originates from react-dom.development.js.
This suggests that React is managing the event, but the actual logic to unselect the product and update the state is not being triggered correctly.

Could you please:

Show me the React component code that renders these checkboxes in the modal. Please include how the checked state and the event handler (e.g., onChange, onClick, or a custom prop) are being applied to each checkbox.
Show me the JavaScript function that is supposed to handle the product selection/deselection logic (i.e., the function that should update the list of selected products).
Based on the noop finding and the React context, please modify the code to correctly wire up the event handling for these checkboxes so that clicking a checked checkbox unselects the product, updates the application's state, and reflects this change in the UI (i.e., the checkbox becomes unchecked and any associated product counts update). Ensure that console.log() statements are temporarily added within the correct handler function so I can see it being triggered and the relevant product ID being processed.
It's important that the actual state change occurs and the UI updates accordingly. The previous attempts did not resolve this."

Why this prompt is effective:

States the Problem Clearly: Reiterates the original issue.
Provides Key Debugging Findings: Specifically mentions the noop handler and its react-dom origin. This is a critical clue for an AI working with React code.
Asks for Specific Code: Requesting the component rendering the checkboxes and the handler function helps the AI (and you) focus on the relevant parts.
Requests a Specific Fix: Clearly asks to "correctly wire up the event handling" and ensure state and UI updates.
Requests Logging for Verification: Asking for console.log helps confirm the fix.
References Previous Attempts: Politely reminds the AI that this is an ongoing issue.
Focuses on React Principles: By highlighting the react-dom finding, it guides the AI to think in terms of React's event system (props like onChange, state updates, etc.) rather than raw DOM manipulation.
